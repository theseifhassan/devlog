# smartfolds.nvim â€” My First Plugin, My First Build in Public

Today, Iâ€™m kicking off a new project: **smartfolds.nvim**.  
Itâ€™s a Neovim plugin that Iâ€™m building to solve a small but really annoying thing I keep running into â€” how folded code looks.

When I'm working with JavaScript or TypeScript, especially with functions that have JSDoc comments, the default folds feel... bad.  
You fold a function and instead of seeing something meaningful, you just get `{...}`. No context, no hint, nothing.  
Itâ€™s frustrating when youâ€™re trying to scan your file and quickly understand whatâ€™s folded.

So I thought: *what if folds could show the function name and signature instead?*  
That small idea is how **smartfolds.nvim** was born.

But honestly, this project is about more than just fixing folds.

Recently, I wrote about feeling a little stuck as a developer â€” like I was just doing the same things over and over.  
This project is me trying to change that.  
Itâ€™s me **exploring new areas of myself**, trying new tools, new ideas, and hopefully finding my passion for building again.

Itâ€™s a chance for me to:
- Learn Lua properly.
- Finally dive into Neovimâ€™s plugin system.
- Build something real, not just read about it.
- And most importantly, **build in public** â€” sharing my progress (and probably a lot of mistakes) openly.

This is my first time doing all of that.  
Iâ€™m excited, a little nervous, but mostly just *happy to be trying*.  
It feels way more fun to learn by actually doing and sharing, even if itâ€™s messy at the start.

Right now, **smartfolds.nvim** is basically just a `vim.notify()` that says "smartfolds.nvim loaded ðŸš€".  
That's it.  
No magic yet.  
But hey, itâ€™s alive â€” and thatâ€™s enough for Day 1.

I'll be posting updates here in my devlog as I go, and sharing the journey on X.com too.  
If you're into Neovim, Lua, or just enjoy watching dev stories unfold (pun intended), Iâ€™d love to have you along for the ride.

Let's see where this goes. ðŸš€
